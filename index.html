      <h1>Thank You for Everything</h1>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Nintyshroom was a Nintendo News Resource site that ran from November 2010 to July 2014. With the help of many volunteers it became a successful blog website reporting on the latest Nintendo related news and gave reviews on upcoming games. Unfortunately due to time and commitment issues the site was forced to close last year. It holds a significant part in my personal journey to becoming a successful Web Developer and I would like to thank you all, the visitors to the site for giving me everything I needed to keep building the site for as long as I did. I've worked with some amazing people, made some great friends and had a whole lot of fun in the process of building and maintaining this site. Thank you all for supporting us, you can still find us on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/Nintyshroom">@Nintyshroom</a> where we may continue to report in Tweet form from time to time.</p>
        <p>Thank you all for supporting the project.</p>

      <h1>The Story Continues on Twitter</h1>
      <p>Nintyshroom will live on in the form of a Twitter account. We're putting together a team of moderators to man the Twitter account to post news and discuss with the community about the latest goings on in the world of Nintendo. Check us out:</p>
